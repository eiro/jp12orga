French Perl Workshop 2012: Call for Papers


The <a href="http://http://journeesperl.fr/">French Perl Workshop</a> 2012 edition will take place in the Epitech de Strasbourg, 
coming 29 and 30 June. 

This new location allows us to rethink the event: longer breaks 
(for more informal communication), space for decisions makers; 
we emphasize dialog, meeting, practicing, interactivity. 

In order to be a success, this conference need <a href="http://journeesperl.fr/fpw2012/register">speakers</a> and <a href="http://journeesperl.fr/fpw2012/newtalk">presentations</a>. 
French is preferred, but English is fine too. 
Some already registered attendees are english speakers.
The theme this year is "Meeting, Learning, Playing, Creating".
